## Unpaywall

[Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/) is "an open database of 21,403,865 free scholarly articles" which is construted by "[harvesting] Open Access content from over 50,000 publishers and repositories" ([Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/)).

We investigated the usefulness and accuracy of Unpaywall for use in economics, and found some issues. This is not a systematic review!

## RePEc
[RePEc (Research Papers in Economics)](http://repec.org/) is a "collaborative effort of hundreds of volunteers in 99 countries to enhance the dissemination of research in Economics and related sciences" ([RePEc](http://repec.org/)).
[IDEAS](https://ideas.repec.org/) is "the largest bibliographic database dedicated to Economics and available freely on the Internet. Based on RePEc, it indexes over 2,700,000 items of research, including over 2,500,000 that can be downloaded in full text" ([IDEAS](https://ideas.repec.org/) ).

## Our Approach

We picked a few DOIs where we know that reasonable data exists on Google Scholar as well as on [IDEAS/RePEc](https://ideas.repec.org/). We then investigated the available information on Unpaywall.

```{r set_dois, cache=TRUE}
# select DOIs
dois = c("10.1257/aer.102.3.589","10.1257/mac.20150245","10.1257/aer.p20171020")
unpaywall <- roadoi::oadoi_fetch(dois,email="lars@vilhuber.com")
refs <- rcrossref::cr_cn(dois,format = "text")
```

### Example 1: Hard
```{r,echo=FALSE,results='markup'}
knitr::kable(unlist(refs[1]),col.names = "Article:")
```
This article in the AER's Papers and Proceedings is found on Unpaywall through CiteSeer:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
example1 <- unpaywall %>% filter(doi == dois[1]) 
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(example1$best_oa_location) %>% select(pmh_id,url))
```

which points to the conference program website. However, a Google search would also have found the full PDF at https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/ldi/2/. As it turns out, the latter, because it is posted AFTER the conference, is actually a better version to use, but that may not be generally the case. 

### Example 2: RePEc has the partial answer
```{r,echo=FALSE,results='markup'}
knitr::kable(unlist(refs[2]),col.names = "Article:")
```
This article in the AER is listed on Unpaywall without an OA option:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
example2 <- unpaywall %>% filter(doi == dois[2]) 
knitr::kable(example2 %>% select(doi,is_oa,journal_is_oa))
```

However, RePEc actually puts this article (https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aejmac/v10y2018i2p52-85.html) in relation to the NBER working paper version (https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/23485.html):
```{r nber2,cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE,results='markup'}
knitr::kable(rcrossref::cr_cn("10.3386/w23485",format = "text"),col.names = "NBER WP:")
```

Note that while the NBER is typically not OA, it can be if you are "a journalist" or "a resident of nearly any developing country or transition economy." Note that this is not coded anywhere.

### Example 3: RePEc has the entire answer
```{r,echo=FALSE,results='markup'}
knitr::kable(unlist(refs[3]),col.names = "Article:")
```
This article in the AER is also listed on Unpaywall without an OA option:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
example3 <- unpaywall %>% filter(doi == dois[3]) 
knitr::kable(example3 %>% select(doi,is_oa,journal_is_oa))
```

However, RePEc actually puts this article (https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v107y2017i5p322-26.html) in relation with not one, but TWO OA versions: to a [Board of Governors Discussion Paper](https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fedgfe/2017-19.html) and a [Center for Economic Studies Working Paper](https://ideas.repec.org/p/cen/wpaper/17-17.html):

![Screenshot of RePEc site](repec_example3.png)

both of which have no download restrictions, and the Board of Governors paper even has a DOI, and thus should be findable within the CrossRef metadata:

```{r fed,cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE,results='markup'}
knitr::kable(rcrossref::cr_cn("10.17016/FEDS.2017.019",format = "text"),col.names = "Board of Governors Discussion Paper:")
```
However, both are findable, and put in relationship to the AER article, within the RePEc metadata.
